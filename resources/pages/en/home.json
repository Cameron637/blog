			"description": "Being a missionary may not have much to do with Computer Science, but it has everything to do with who I've become over the last few years. For two years I served complete strangers every day for more than 14 hours a day. I would help them in any way possible, and teach those who were interested about the Gospel of Jesus Christ. A valuable skill I picked up here is Spanish-English and English-Spanish translation, which I did for both large meetings and small interviews."

			"description": "Coming to BYU for my undergraduate degree was an excellent decision. Being here has challenged me to perform beyond what I thought I could do. Here I am privileged to have opportunities to grow not just in my understanding and love of Computer Science, but also in my faith and dedication to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. So far I've learned C++, C, assembly, data structures, and discrete mathemetics."
