        "Here is something I learned this week that I posted about on Facebook:",
        "\"You know, with all this noise and everyone saying they hate America or are ashamed to be an American, I would just like to say that I am and always will be very proud to be an American. I may disagree with Trump on many issues, but I'll support him as President unless he does something worthy of impeachment. I may disagree with people rioting, but that doesn't make me ashamed to be an American. The fact that they can riot and not get mowed down by military forces is a sign that we still live in a free country. You see, my pride in America doesn't depend on what other Americans do, it depends on what I do with that freedom that's been given me. I am extremely proud to live in a country that allows me to worship God and express my beliefs as I see fit. I am very proud to live in a country where I can become anything I want to be with enough hard work and sacrifice. Having seen first hand the incredible sacrifices of our soldiers, like my father Ed Sanchez, and their families, like my mother Annette Bennett Sanchez, I am extremely proud of each of our soldiers. The media only focuses on the negative, but there are still so many reasons to be proud to be an American, and they are easy to find when you count your blessings.\"",
        "There's too much noise on Facebook and in the media.  It's important to take a step back and view life through a calm, cool, and collected perspective.  Then we can see how wonderfully blessed we are to live in this great land."
